Start the virtual machine -> we can go back to the last snapshot/state of the machine -> properties -> current state

We are going to use:
-Normal.sam -> SAM format: information on the alignment in the text format
-Tumor.sam
-CG100.bed -> The BED (Browser Extensible Data) format is a text file format used to store genomic regions as coordinates and associated annotations.

We could open them with a text editor but they are quite big so it is not really that useful!

SAMTOOL -> tool to manage bam and sam files

1. Open in the terminal the DATA folder containing the .sam files and the .bed file

Command: cd Data to move inside the directory

Command: ls -la -> list of files plus other info

Command: ls -lha -> list of files with also the info on the size

Command: clear -> if the terminal is a mess!

2. Have a look at the .sam file -> command head Normal.sam

@HD     VN:1.4  GO:none SO:coordinate
@SQ     SN:1    LN:249250621
@SQ     SN:2    LN:243199373
@SQ     SN:3    LN:198022430

The header contains:
- Version (VN)
- Sorting
- Read groups with platform information
- Reference sequences used for the mapping: SN:chromosome_number LN: lengths
- Processing history → program used: ID:name_program

3. Call samtools (here in version 1.7) -> samtools or samtools -help -> Show us the help of the command
There are different parameters that can be used:
- One is flags -> explain bam flags -> example of usage: samtools flag 165 -> we get an explanation


4. SAMTOOLS DEFAULT OPERATIONS
- By default samtools (not all operations) expects a BAM file as input and will produce a SAM file as output

- Alignment results are typically stored as a sorted and indexed BAM file

- Aligners produce SAM files so our first job is usually to convert those to BAM formats.

5. SAM to BAM
- Convert a SAM into a BAM: samtools view -Sbh Normal.sam > Normal.bam

If we don't add the > Normal.bam, the output will be printed to the terminal
samtools view -> tells us the usage -> samtools view [options] <is.bam>
-S -> input format is auto detected
-b -> output a .bam file
-h -> include the header in the file

- Sort a BAM file: samtools sort Normal.bam > Normal.sorted.bam
The default is to sort by position.
We use the command samtools sort.

- Create index: samtools index Normal.sorted.bam
We use samtools index -> create an index file for the specific .bam file in input -> the index file is used by other softwares to retrive information about the bam and sam files
Create a .bai file -> need to be in the same folder of the .bam file because the softwares look for the .bam file and then look for a .bai file with the same name of the .bam file!

SORTING
Way of sorting:
- Sorted so that read pairs are next to one another (typically the same order as the FastQ
file) -> sorted by the name of te reads
- Sorted by alignment position
- Depending on the next analysis method your file has to be sorted a certain way -> depending on the used softwares (even though usually we sort by position -> faster)

Compare the two sortings:
samtools sort -n Normal.bam > Normal.sorted.rname.bam
-n -> to sort based on the name of the reads
Create a new .bam file sorted by the name of the reads and not by the position (=default option for samtools sort)
If we want to use it with an index, we need to create a specific index for it. The index made on the sort by position doesn't work on the bam file sorted by read name.


samtools view Normal.sorted.bam | less
We use the command samtools view -> using the pipe less we only print a part of the file created via samtools view

The info we have:
-ID name
-flag
-chromosome reference
-position on the chromosome
We can see that a lot of reads map in the same position in the chromosome reference
-CIGAR

samtools view Normal.sorted.rname.bam | less
The info is the same, just we don't start from chromosome 1 as in the position sorting but, since the sorting is based on the read name, it is easier to find pair of reads


5. FILTERING
We can filter the reads based on flags:
- Required flag (keep the reads if the flag matches): samtools view -f INT -> need the flag number 
- Filtering (remove the read if the flag matches, keep everything aside the matched reads): samtools view -F INT -> need the flag number

Example:
samtools view -f 163 
samtools view -F 163 
This is a fast way to filter the reads based on flags
NB not all numbers exist as flags

Count reads in BAM file: samtools view -c Normal.sorted.bam
-c -> counts the read in the file

Reads that map to reverse strand: samtools view -c -f 16 Normal.sorted.bam
We can combine -c and -f -> count only the reads with the specific flags choosen

Reads that map to the forward strand: samtools view -c -F 16 Normal.sorted.bam

NB. sometimes the number of the maps are not equal -> depends if every reads have the mate of the pair end sequencing

Reads that have a mapping quality >30: samtools view -c -q 30 Normal.sorted.bam
-q -> treshold for the quality of the reads -> here we filter for reads with quality > 30


6. Explore statistics

- General statistics : samtools flagstat Normal.sorted.bam
samtools flagstat -> gives info on the statistics of the alignment, such as if there are duplicates, secondary or supplementary reads, etc.
Usually, these statistis change as the analysisi is operated -> for example, happen often on duplicates because right now we did't operate any analysis on them so tehy are counted as 0.

- Detailed statistics: use samtools stats
samtools stats Normal.sorted.bam > Stats.txt
less Stats.txt

More detailed file-> like quality of all the cycle of sequencing
Useful -> in the different regions of teh file tehre are specific ways to extract info using the command grep -> there are suggestions on how to do this in the output file  -> like use grep .....

7. Explore coverage statistics

- Single base sum coverage per region:
samtools bedcov CG100.bed Normal.sorted.bam > BEDCov.txt

The .bad file is a text file -> less CG100.bed -> columns: chromosome, start, end, name/annotation -> a text file that gives us the coordinates of a region, each associated to a specific name.
We can use these files to filter our files.

samtools bedcov is used to have an idea on how many reads of the .bam map on the region kept in the .bed file


less BEDCov.txt

Output file: same region of the .bed plus another columns indicating the number of reads mapping in that region



- Single base depth
samtools depth -b CG100.bed Normal.sorted.bam > BEDDepth.txt
samtools depth give us the coverage on each base included in the .bad regions


less BEDDepth.txt
We don't have the regions and the number of reads mapping there.
Here we get the number of reads that map in the nucleotide that are found in each region in the .bed file -> coverage on each specific base-> mapping of reads respect to each nucleotide of the regions in the .bed file -> nucleotide for nucleotide
What we have in the output: chromosome, position of the nucleotide in the chromosome, coverage

8. mpileup

Test mpileup: samtools mpileup Normal.sorted.bam | less

Pileup of a region: samtools mpileup -r 1:3410684-3410690 Normal.sorted.bam

Control base and mapping quality:  samtools mpileup -r 1:3410684-3410690 -q 60 -Q 60
Normal.sorted.bam


9. Tasks

Repeat previous commands on file Tumor.sam

Check pileup of following positions
– 1:196642233
– 10:114192285
– 17:7578265
– 3:128204654

and comment results (compare Normal and Tumor)

Test if results change by filtering reads on base and mapping quality
