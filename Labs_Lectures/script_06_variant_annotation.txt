TASKS:
1. Annotate BCF and GATK variant calls VCF files (recoded ones) with hg19kg database
2. Annotate with Hapmap and Clinvar pathogenic variants
3. Compare stats
4. Find in both files variants that have
    a. HIGH impact
    b. Coverage > 20
    c. An rsID
5. Which of these variants is annotated in Clinvar?


Call SNPEffector using VCF files, for both BCF and GATK
1) java -Xmx4g -jar ../Tools/snpEff/snpEff.jar -v hg19kg ../05_VariantCalling/Data/Sample.BCF.recode.vcf -s Sample.BCF.recode.ann.html > Sample.BCF.recode.ann.vcf

-> We generate an annotate.vcf and a .html

-> let's explore the annotated vcf file: it is a normal VCF file with all teh info and other info lines that hae been hadded to the header of teh metadata -> info added by SNPEffector -> the most important is the annotation lines -> at a certain point of the INFO string added by SNPEffector, we have a code ANN that contain the info, divided by the pipe |.  Some type of annotations are: protein_coding, intron_variant, missense_variant, moderate_effect, etc
-> it is a text file so it can be read!
-> we can extract the data creating a python code
-> look at the html file to have an overview -> tells us the command line lounches, the warnings (=not a big deal), errors (= top if it is equal to 0), number of variants and number of lines -> there can be differences in these two lines, here for example, we analyze 7432 lines and 7447 variants -> this difference is because of teh multialleles -> here we have 50 cases that have more than 1 variant, so a multiple alleles. The analysis of annotation is operated on the variants so we can hav emore variants than lines in the files.
We also have the genome length, the effective genome length -> differences because we used only the info on the chr 20 to generate the VCF files and the variant rate.
Table of Number variant by types -> all SNPs -> we filtered against indels and insertions
Summary and classifications of number of effects stratified by the impact -> biggest part of the effect predicted is modifier -> so unable to predict. After we have low and moderate effect -> not easy to predict the effect.
Summary and classifications of number of effects stratified by the functional class -> majority are missense
More detailed stratification of the effects divided by type and region (downstream, upstream, introns, splising sites, UTR regions, etc) -> here a big percentage of the calls fall in the intron region, 53%. Only 30% fall in the exonic regions -> a lot of time the calls are not happening in a sequence that give rise to a protein. So ot can be difficult to repdict the effect of these modification. Other modification can be found in the regulatory region, so the upstream regions -> change the level of expression of the proteins.
Graph of the variations divided by type
Quality summary -> min, max, mean, median, standard deviation, values and counts per values. Associated to a plot of the distribution of the values.
Insertion and deletion length -> histogram -> here we don't have them because there are no ins or del -> we left them out when creating the VCF file.
Matrix of the base changes for the SNPs -> we can see how often a base is changed into another base -> not an equal presentation -> not the same numbers for every change -> here a lot of time the C became A and G become T.
Summary of teh changing of the bases in transition and transvertion. Can be used to operate Mutational signals analysis: association of specific mutation signature to specific diseases -> like smoke or liver damage -> the type of changes observed is the same.
Allele frequency -> not super useful sometimes
Allele count -> not super useful sometimes
Hom/Het per sample -> not super useful sometimes
Codon change -> the changes in codons that pairs with the amino acids changes table -> we can see which amino acid changed -> as the color gets more dark, the change of codon is observed more.
Amino acids changes table 
With all these info we can get an idea of what is happening in the sample -> bases that are changing and so on.
Variants by chromosome -> specific for each chromosome -> we can see where the variants are accumulating in the actual sequence


2) java -Xmx4g -jar ../Tools/snpEff/snpEff.jar -v hg19kg ../05_VariantCalling/Data/Sample.GATK.recode.vcf -s Sample.GATK.recode.ann.html > Sample.GATK.recode.ann.vcf


-> compare the results with the VCF file -> teh number of variants here is lower. In this case, we have 84% of modifier and 61% of the SNPs are missense. Th emajority of teh variants are found in introns (=51%).
We can say, that even if the numbers are a little different, the results are comparable and both tools give us an info that is comparable -> tehre is not a best one respect to the two of them.
The main difference can be seen in the amino acid table

Call Annotate -> additional passage on the vcf files. We use databases to add annotations. We use two different annotation -> hapmap and clinvar

3) java -Xmx4g -jar ../Tools/snpEff/SnpSift.jar Annotate ../Annotations/hapmap_3.3.b37.vcf  Sample.BCF.recode.ann.vcf > Sample.BCF.recode.ann2.vcf

4) java -Xmx4g -jar ../Tools/snpEff/SnpSift.jar Annotate ../Annotations/clinvar_Pathogenic.vcf Sample.GATK.recode.ann2.vcf > Sample.GATK.recode.ann3.vcf


5) java -Xmx4g -jar ../Tools/snpEff/SnpSift.jar Annotate ../Annotations/clinvar_Pathogenic.vcf Sample.BCF.recode.ann2.vcf > Sample.BCF.recode.ann3.vcf


6) java -Xmx4g -jar ../Tools/snpEff/SnpSift.jar Annotate ../Annotations/hapmap_3.3.b37.vcf  Sample.GATK.recode.ann.vcf > Sample.GATK.recode.ann2.vcf


-> let's open one file: annotate2 of BCF: We have a normal vcf file -> the info fields are populated one after the other, we have some new info and new annotations -> addition of annotation from the databases.
We can see that the info lines are different between annotation 2 and annotation 3 files from teh same tool -> the string of the annotations are different because we used different databases and tools

Filter the files -> filter the events -> filter for the position of the variants that satisfy the filter -> to carry on the analysis on only impacting and wanted variants

7) cat Sample.BCF.recode.ann3.vcf | java -Xmx4g -jar ../Tools/snpEff/SnpSift.jar filter "(ANN[ANY].IMPACT = 'HIGH') & (DP > 20) & (exists ID)" -> there are 2: DP: 36, 23.
8) cat Sample.GATK.recode.ann3.vcf | java -Xmx4g -jar ../Tools/snpEff/SnpSift.jar filter "(ANN[ANY].IMPACT = 'HIGH') & (DP > 20) & (exists ID)" -> there are 3, DP: 46, 36, 23. 

NB using different tolls give rise to different results

Under, we ask specifically for the annotation relative to the clinical significance -> CLNSIG
9) cat Sample.BCF.recode.ann3.vcf | java -Xmx4g -jar ../Tools/snpEff/SnpSift.jar filter "(exists CLNSIG)"-> there is 1 variant, that is associated to clinical significance: Pathogenic.
10) cat Sample.GATK.recode.ann3.vcf | java -Xmx4g -jar ../Tools/snpEff/SnpSift.jar filter "(exists CLNSIG)" -> there are 3: Pathogenic.
