Exercise:

cd Data

ls # returns -> smartpca, faststructure, ethseq

##### Run SMARTPCA

1) go in SMARTPCA folder
cd smartpca

2) Convert the PED and MAP file into SMARTPCA input files -> the two files 100s and 16s differs only in the number of samples they contains: 100  samples or 16 samples
./EIG5.0.2/bin/convertf -p par.PED.EIGENSTRAT.100s
./EIG5.0.2/bin/convertf -p par.PED.EIGENSTRAT.16s

3) Run SMARTPCA analysis -> when we run it, it print the inpout files, the samples analyzed and the number of SNPs used. Plus, if a part of teh SNPs were lefted out/killed.
# This analysis is PCA based so a summary of the PCA is returned, with the eigenvector and the dimentions of SNPs and individuals.
# Plus, a plot is returned, containing the SNPs
./EIG5.0.2/bin/smartpca -p 1000GP_Genotypes100s.pca.par
./EIG5.0.2/bin/smartpca -p 1000GP_Genotypes16s.pca.par

cd ..

##### Run EthSEQ

1) go in the folder for ethseq
cd ethseq

2) run the script
Rscript Run.R # there is a R script already implemented to operate the EthSEQ anlysis
#  what the script look like? Look under in the R SCRIPT PART!
# we get the outputs in teh folders:
# -> RGraph.Output -> the PCA plots of teh target, model and teh refinement process. We can understand teh stratification of teh ethnicity ansd see if the samples fall in a specific subspace for a specific ethnicity
# the 16s fiel is smaller tha n the 100s file -> only 16 points in the PCA plots
# ->  the file RReport.PCA.Acord -> data of the report
# -> file Rreport.txt-> file that tell us if each samples are inside a specific population subspace or near a specific population, each row is a sample


cd ..

##### Run fastSTRUCTURE

cd faststructure

## run the examples and create plots
# the -k parameter is used to define the number of ethnicity we should start our analysis with -> deciding k can be difficult -> if we know that there is for sure a certain number of population, it will be easier. Defining k is difficult in unsupervised clustering, usually different approaches are used and a statistical analyisi is often associated to teh result to understand in the k is good. A treshold on the max k can be inserted -> so it is not needed to set a minimum k but a max k is selected
# needed to run both structure.py and distruct.py code
# the code can be find in the folder or at the end of the page.

python fastStructure/structure.py -K 4 --input=1000GP_Genotypes100s --output=1000GP_Genotypes100s --full --seed=100
python fastStructure/distruct.py -K 4 --input=1000GP_Genotypes100s --output=1000GP_Genotypes100s.svg

## Compare the tools EthSEQ and SMARTPCA
1) Call R from teh terminal and open te AnalysisScript.R

R SCRIPT for EthSEQ: Run.R in the folder

library(EthSEQ)

ethseq.Analysis(
  target.vcf = "./1000GP_Genotypes100s.vcf",
  out.dir = "./100s",
  model.gds = "./ReferenceModel.gds",
  cores=1,
  verbose=TRUE,
  composite.model.call.rate = 0.99,
  space="3D")

ethseq.Analysis(
  target.vcf = "./1000GP_Genotypes16s.vcf",
  out.dir = "./16s",
  model.gds = "./ReferenceModel.gds",
  cores=1,
  verbose=TRUE,
  composite.model.call.rate = 0.99,

1) STRUCTURE.PY
2) DESTRUCT.PY



Comparison Anlysis in R:


folder = "~/Documents/HumanGenomics/07_AncestryAnalysis/Data/"
setwd(folder)

### 100 samples analysis -> upload teh results of the prevoius analysis in R using read.table -> we have the three files
ethseq.coord = read.table(file.path(folder,"ethseq/100s/Report.PCAcoord"),sep="\t",as.is=T,header=T) # each line is a sample, each coord is a dimention -> a colum
ethseq.report = read.table(file.path(folder,"ethseq/100s/Report.txt"),sep="\t",as.is=T,header=T) # report
smartpca.coord = read.table(file.path(folder,"smartpca/1000GP_Genotypes100s.pca.evec"),as.is=T) # each line is a sample, plus we have different variable dimentions -> coordinates in the space

## check samples order -> to be sure to compare sample 1 against sample 1 -> are the sample in the same position in all the files?
all(ethseq.coord[,1]==smartpca.coord[,1])
all(ethseq.report[,1]==smartpca.coord[,1])

## plot PCA space -> we can plot the PCA of teh two (SMARTPCA and EthSEQ) and compare them
par(mfrow=c(2,3),mar=c(4,4,4,1)) # to plot all toghether-> generate a window in which the plots will be included
plot(ethseq.coord$EV1,ethseq.coord$EV2,pch=19,xlab="PCA1",ylab="PCA2",main="EthSEQ") 
plot(ethseq.coord$EV2,ethseq.coord$EV3,pch=19,xlab="PCA2",ylab="PCA3",main="EthSEQ")
plot(ethseq.coord$EV1,ethseq.coord$EV3,pch=19,xlab="PCA1",ylab="PCA3",main="EthSEQ")
plot(smartpca.coord[,2],smartpca.coord[,3],pch=19,xlab="PCA1",ylab="PCA2",main="SMARTPCA")
plot(smartpca.coord[,3],smartpca.coord[,4],pch=19,xlab="PCA2",ylab="PCA3",main="SMARTPCA")
plot(smartpca.coord[,2],smartpca.coord[,4],pch=19,xlab="PCA1",ylab="PCA3",main="SMARTPCA")
# on the bottom we have the plots for the SMARTPCA, on the top we have the plots for the EthSEQ.
# For each we look at the first three dimentions -> explain the highes percentage of variance of teh data -> teh most informative dimentions -> the other dimentions explain less
# we can see in all the plots 4 clusters, both in EthSEQ and SMARTPCA -> cearer definition in EthSEQ though. The PCA component 1 is not exactly teh same of SMARTPCA component 1 but in teh end what is found is the same.

# comparing the PC component of the two tools
par(mfrow=c(1,3),mar=c(4,4,4,1))
plot(ethseq.coord$EV1,smartpca.coord[,2],pch=19,xlab="PCA1 (EthSEQ)",ylab="PCA1 (SMARTPCA)",main="EthSEQ/SMARTPCA")
plot(ethseq.coord$EV2,smartpca.coord[,3],pch=19,xlab="PCA2 (EthSEQ)",ylab="PCA2 (SMARTPCA)",main="EthSEQ/SMARTPCA")
plot(ethseq.coord$EV3,smartpca.coord[,4],pch=19,xlab="PCA3 (EthSEQ)",ylab="PCA3 (SMARTPCA)",main="EthSEQ/SMARTPCA")
# PC1 of the two tolls are the same, PC2 are slightly different, for PC3 we can see a correlation. Going up in the dimension (=less variance explained), we have less similarity between the two tools

## compare fastSTRUCTURE and EthSEQ report
faststructure = read.table(file.path(folder,"faststructure/1000GP_Genotypes100s.4.meanQ"),as.is=T,header=F)
ids =  read.table(file.path(folder,"faststructure/1000GP_Genotypes100s.fam"),as.is=T,header=F)
faststructure$id = ids[,2]

sel = ethseq.report$pop[which(ethseq.report$sample.id%in%faststructure[which(faststructure[,1]>=0.99),5])] # take the ids of the first population in EthSEQ and understand where these ids are in SMARTPCA -> are in the faststructure?
