EX 1 -> RCode_DNAcopy.R

To generate the data necessary for teh second part of R script we need to enter in teh folder Data -> cd Data -> follow the EX2

Here we have two files: normal.bam and a tumor.bam, both already filtered to contain data on chr 13 and 20 and sorted.


EX 2

## Somatic copy number

1) move in teh folder Data

cd Data

2) generate a pileup of the files-> one column of teh pileup is the coverage -> we are just making teh coverage available for the tool we are using after -> we are extracting teh info of the coverage

samtools mpileup -q 1 -f ../../Annotations/human_g1k_v37.fasta Normal_chr13_chr20.sorted.bam Tumor_chr13_chr20.sorted.bam | java -jar ../../Tools/VarScan.v2.3.9.jar copynumber --output-file SCNA --mpileup 1

3)  We use VarScan and explicit the copynumber tool -> to transform teh coverage in Copy Numbers

java -jar ../../Tools/VarScan.v2.3.9.jar copyCaller SCNA.copynumber --output-file SCNA.copynumber.called

# we can see the number of the regions that have a specific call: amplification, deletion, neutral. Plus we get the number of called that passed the thresholds
# teh file contains the agjusted_logratio -> adjusted on the Copy number
# the files now have a column with the call association for eeach read
# here we are trying to call an event for each part of teh genome, we are not oerating a segmentation -> we are just analyzing the log2 ratio.
# WE can use this info to perform Circular Segmentation!

4) Run R script with DNAcopy segmentation
