# Computational Human Genomics
This project is part of the course in Computational Human Genomics, held by Dr.Yari Ciani and Prof. Francesca Demichelis, during the A.A. 2022-2023. We started from two BAM files (Tumor and matched Control), along with other files (reference genome, annotation files, ...) with the aim to perform Germline Variant Calling, Somatic Small and Copy-Number Variant Calling, Ancestry Analysis, and Tumor Ploidy and Purity estimation.

In particular, the project is aimed at answering 10 specific tasks:

    Explore statistics about the raw aligned reads contained in the two BAM files

    Perform realignment and recalibration on those

    Identify and annotate heterozygous SNPs

    Determine the ancestry of the patients

    Identify somatic copy number variants

    Identify somatic point mutations

    Determine how DNA Repair Genes have been impacted by germline CNVs and SNPs

    Determine which DNA repair genes overlap both germline heterozygous copy-number deletions and somatic point mutations

    Determine tumor purity and ploidy

    Determine the similarity of Tumor and Control samples
