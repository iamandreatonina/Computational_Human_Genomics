What are we gonna do -> look at the document in the drive for a full text

1) Genomic studies -> used to explore oncology or other context -> need info o somatic events -> obtained via bulk sequencing, from different patients (=cohorts of circa 200 patients) -> in this way we have a significance with which we can answer specific biological/clinical questions.
Here we will analyze a single patient -> caso of study -> we can obtain informative info if teh analysis is good enough.

2) We start form .bam files (=tumor and control), identify all the somatic events (copy numbers, SNV, indels etc). We also need to run quality checks, sample identity checks, visual inspection and population charactherization (=identify the populations-etnicity). We need to use just the tool we studied -> no other tools required.
AIM: study the patient and the somatic events.
We can run all the analysis or run only a few, plus we need to choose which filters to apply and others.

3) Notes: if we need to determine the genotype we can use ASEReadCounter -> use the threshold written in the document

Please note that th eprovided .bam files are limited in genomic size -> some intermediary files may take too m uch space -> GB of files -> pay attention if we use the virtual machine -> expand teh space of teh machine or perform the analysis only to certain regions or use the parameter max_depth/max_coverage to limit the space (like 100 coverage) and time. Plus, remember that it is possible to set the number of threads.


FORM OF THE PROJECT:
max 4 pages, info on the fonts/size on the drive text. Figures with the related legends are needed -> at least 2 figures, max 4 figures -> we need to chose the results more relevant, select them and explain them in a detailed way -> need to explain the axis, what is teh input data, what each point in the plot is and what kind of statistical analysis was done if we did it!

Must contain teh project rationale -> max 10 lines
Computational workflow -> all the details to reproduce exactly the things we done, the input files, the tools used, etc
Results with interpretation
Criticism-Limitations -> max 10 lines, if it is necessary

Groups of 3-4 students each.


To complete this project and send the report before the exam -> send it 1 week before the exam or earlier.

A part of the oral exam will be on this project -> why we did a certain analysis or why we obtained that data.
